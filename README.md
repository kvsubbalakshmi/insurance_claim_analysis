# Insurance Risk & Claim Analysis

### 📌 Project Overview
This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze insurance policies and claim patterns. The goal is to provide stakeholders with clear insights into customer demographics, claim behaviours, and risk factors, enabling data-driven business decisions.

### 🏢 Business Problem
The insurance company’s policy and claims data were scattered across multiple sources, making it difficult to:
- Track overall performance
- Identify claim trends and customer risk profiles
- Segment customers effectively for policy targeting
  
This dashboard centralizes the data into one place and provides key KPIs and visual insights for better decision-making.
